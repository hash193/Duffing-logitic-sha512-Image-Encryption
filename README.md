# Chaotic Image Encryption and Decryption using 2D Logistic & Duffing Maps
This project implements a grayscale image encryption and decryption system using chaotic maps‚Äîspecifically, the 2D Logistic Map and Duffing Map‚Äîto perform pixel-level scrambling and substitution. The system ensures high security, unpredictability, and robustness against statistical and differential attacks, evaluated using standard image encryption metrics.
üìñ Abstract:
In the field of secure image transmission, chaotic systems have emerged as efficient tools for designing lightweight, fast, and secure encryption algorithms. This project explores a hybrid chaotic encryption technique that combines the 2D Logistic Map and Duffing Map for confusion and diffusion processes. The system incorporates SHA-512 hashing of the input image to generate key parameters, thereby enhancing the encryption's sensitivity.
